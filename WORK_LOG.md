After all, this is what we were told the problem set was about. So, I just wanted to create a recurssive solution. To do this, I thought a lot about what the optimal substructure would be. I originally thought back to our heating up problem set and remembered that our substructure involved getting all of the nodes that were smaller than our target node. After doing some more thinking however, I could not figure out a way to adapt this substructure to diff :( Finally, I thought about using the starting letter from the first string, and looking for the first instance of that char in the second string. From there, I would keep going down the line and looking for the next possible path. However, I realized this solution was incredibily inefficient and wasn't even recursive. |

Instead of thinking of possible substructures, I thought of possible base cases. Obviously, I thought of going out of bounds as a base case, but I couldn't really think of any others since I didn't have a substructure yet. So, I went back to thinking about substructures. I found it VERY HARD to think of anything except what I thought of in my first attempt in my above entry. I even tried thinking about what I did for heating up, but nothing was helping. I ultimately just gave up for the day and called it a night. |

What you told us is that we should try thinking as if we were in the middle of the problem, and we already had our solutions from the previous characters. |
| February 5  | 9:30-10:30pm | Tonight, I used what I learned from class today (I outlined that in the above entry) to think of an optimal substructure. So, I imagined that I was in the middle of the example that is shown in the problem set description. However, I could only think of things similar to my first "solution." I could only think of being at the same index in both texts, and adding one to a count every time the character was the same across both texts. Since I couldn't think of anything else, I pursued my idea. I first realized that the indexes should not be connected because the problem set description outlines that the characters can be at different indeces. So, I thought that every character in the first string should be anchored until a matching character in the second string was found. Once that was found, I would go to the next index, and go again. After thinking some more, I began to gain some confidence in the solution, but I was still a little bit unsure if it was a good solution |

I then quickly made memoization work after that, and I didn't actually run into many errors at all. |

Then, I began working on my tabulation approach. I started by creating the 2D array that would store all of my solution and I made sure to increase each direction by 1 to include my base case. From there, I just adapted the other cases I used in my memoization solution like if the character is the same in the same spot in each string. However, it did not work completely at first. I kept getting a lot of out of bounds errors because I was indexing into the wrong spots in my 2D array. After a while of just trying different +1s and -1s everywhere, I took a step back to really think about the indexes more. After a few more trials, I finally escaped the out of bounds errors! After solving one more small error, it worked! |
